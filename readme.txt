The Anasa class library is in src/main/net.anasa.util (no touchey touchey)

The math API is in the package src/main/net.anasa.math (do whatever* you want in there)
* figuratively, Cam.

I'll try and make a more useful and less silly readme (this is a placeholder file so GitHub won't display a warning message).
